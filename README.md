#### This is my first attempt using Vega Lite API to build data visualization. I used the very basic MTR Car dataset for my visual. In this practice, I built colored bar chart, scatter plot, pie/donut chart with testing comments.
Also can find my code on JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/HarpSkye/ewxs0u6t/
## Next Step
#### Find a dataset includes DateTime, Geographic data to build Heatmap, Geographical Map and other charts.
