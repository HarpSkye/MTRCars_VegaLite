<p> This is my first attempt using Vega Lite API to build data visualization. I used the very basic MTR Car dataset for my visual. In this practice, I built colored bar chart, scatter plot, pie/donut chart with testing comments.</p>
<p> Github Result: https://harpskye.github.io/MTRCars_VegaLite/ </p>
<p> Also can find my code on JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/HarpSkye/ewxs0u6t/ </p>

<h4> Next Step </h4>
<p> Find a dataset includes DateTime, Geographic data to build Heatmap, Geographical Map and other charts. </p>
